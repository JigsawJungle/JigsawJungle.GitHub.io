                    a tool that can help mankind with providing better healthcare, economic simulations that can redistribute wealth, and creating prediction models
                    that can map out the virus infections in a given population. </p>

                <p class="ai2">However AI isn't perfect by any means. It will require more years of development until it can be used in 
                    large-scale applications such as driverless cars or in complicated brain surgery. There are groundbreaking discoveries made each day in the 
                    AI research field, propelling humanity to a more efficient world. </p>

                <p class="CGI">Computer graphic images (CGI): This aspect of computer design helps transform movies, video games, or even presentations into eye-opening events. The beauty given by CGI renders people speechless at times. 
                CGI is useful for illustrating worlds that existed in the past or giving shape to a person's dreams. There are therapeutic benefits of CGI by giving people a world to escape in whether it is a movie or a video game. </p>

                <p class="VG">Video Games: Video games are a multi-billion dollar industry that have made a profound change in the computing world. Modern video games (such as Cyberpunk 2077, as shown with Keanu Reeves in the image) are 
                    unique experiences where the user-player can imagine they are on a journey. Video games have made an impact in the last 30 years in society with online multi-player games, where people can connect with like-minded individuals and forge friendships.</p>

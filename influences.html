                    large-scale applications such as driverless cars or in brain surgery. I want to be on the forefront of helping to develop new
                projects that can use AI for humankind's betterment.  </p>

                    I love going movies and escaping into a world built by CGI, and I have seen a few art exhibits that use CGI to impress viewers. </p>

                <p class="VG">Video games have been a part of my life since I was 2 years old, and I continually find it to be an enjoyable passtime for myself. Modern video games (such as Cyberpunk 2077) are 
                    unique events where the player can make-believe they are on a journey that can change a world. I like exploratory, Japanese RPGs, or stealth games for my preferred
                categories. Video games have made an impact in the last 30 years in society with multi-player games found online, where people can connect with like-minded individuals and forge friendships.</p>
